🚀 Automating EC2 Cost Savings with AWS Lambda! 💡

Managing cloud costs efficiently is crucial for any organization. One simple yet effective way is to automate EC2 instance shutdown and startup using AWS Lambda & EventBridge! ⏳💰

🔹 Use Case: Stop non-essential EC2 instances every Friday evening and start them again on Monday morning to save costs.

 🔹 Tools Used:

 ✅ AWS Lambda (Python/Boto3)

 ✅ Amazon EventBridge (Scheduled Rules)

 ✅ AWS IAM (Permissions for Lambda)

Implementation Steps:

1️⃣ Create an IAM Role with EC2 stop/start permissions.

 2️⃣ Write a Lambda function using Boto3 to stop/start instances.

 3️⃣ Set up an EventBridge rule to trigger Lambda on schedule.

 4️⃣ Monitor & optimize with AWS CloudWatch Logs.

📌 Benefits:

 ✅ Reduce cloud costs by stopping idle instances.

 ✅ Fully automated—no manual intervention needed!

 ✅ Enhances cloud efficiency & sustainability.
